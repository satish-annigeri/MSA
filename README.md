# MSA - Matrix structural analysis of skeletal structures

Python package for the direct stiffness method of matrix analysis of skeletal structures. At present a subpackage `pf` for analysis of plane frames has been implemented. Code is based on the flow charts in *Weaver and Gere* and an example is taken from *Hall and Kabaila*.
